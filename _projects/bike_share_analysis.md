- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends in ride frequency, duration, and seasonal variations.
- **User Behavior Analysis:** Compared usage patterns between **casual riders** and **annual members** to support marketing strategies.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generated new features to improve analytical insights.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted hypothesis testing to validate differences in ride behavior.
- **Data Visualization:** Used **ggplot2** in R to create intuitive visualizations showcasing key trends.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** R, SQL
- **Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2
- **Tools:** RStudio, Tableau
- **Data Processing:** SQL-based queries for structured data analysis

## Outcome
The analysis provided actionable insights to **improve bike-share service strategies**, such as **promotional offers for casual riders** and **optimized fleet distribution** based on peak usage times.
