## Overview
This project focuses on building and deploying an **NLP-based text summarization tool** to generate concise summaries from extensive textual content.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Applied techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF for feature extraction.
- **Summarization Methods:** Implemented both **extractive** (key sentence selection) and **abstractive** (semantic-based) summarization approaches.
- **Libraries & Models:** Utilized **NLTK** for preprocessing and **Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers** for deep learning-based summarization.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measured performance using **ROUGE score** to optimize accuracy.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Built a REST API to serve the summarization model efficiently.
- **Deployment:** Hosted the application on **AWS** with a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated updates and real-time summarization.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** NLTK, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Deployment:** AWS (CI/CD)

## Outcome
This tool successfully enables **efficient and scalable text summarization**, making it useful for applications like news aggregation, document analysis, and content generation.
