## Overview
This project focuses on developing an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts student performance based on previous academic records.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key performance indicators and preprocessed raw datasets.
- **Data Pipelines:** Engineered pipelines for preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained and evaluated models using Scikit-learn, optimizing hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Built a RESTful API using FastAPI to serve predictions.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrated logging for performance tracking and debugging.
- **Deployment:** Deployed the model on AWS using a CI/CD pipeline for automated updates.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Deployment:** AWS (CI/CD)

## Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can predict student performance based on historical data, providing valuable insights for educators and institutions.
