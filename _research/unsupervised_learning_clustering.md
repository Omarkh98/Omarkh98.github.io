## 🔍 **Key Insights**
- **Cluster Analysis Overview:**  
  - Goal: Identify **meaningful groupings** in **unlabeled data**.  
  - Methods: **Centroid-based, Hierarchical, Model-based** approaches.  

- **K-Means Clustering (O(IKND))**  
  - Iterative method alternating between **centroids and membership assignment**.  
  - Optimization techniques: **Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, Gap Statistics**.  

- **Hierarchical Clustering (O(N³))**  
  - **Agglomerative (bottom-up merging)** vs. **Divisive (top-down splitting)** approaches.  
  - Linkage Criteria: **Single, Complete, Average**.  

- **Spectral Clustering (O(N³))**  
  - Converts data into a **graph representation** and applies clustering using **Laplacian Matrix eigenvalues**.  

- **Model-Based Clustering (Gaussian Mixture Models – GMMs)**  
  - Uses **probabilistic models** to estimate cluster assignments.  
  - **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm to maximize log-likelihood.  

- **Cluster Validity Measures:**
